# Analgesia_Spring

As part of the masters in data science program at University of Denver, students are encouraged to find an internship.  My client was a surgeon at CU Denver.  Dr. Donnelly was leading a study to see if changes in anesthesiology could have a positive effect on the patients, possibly reducing recovery time and/or reducing nausea in the patients.

I was given data culled from the health records of multiple surgical patients.  To kick off the project, I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) with little knowledge of the doctor's theory.  I was then later asked to perform additional analysis given specific direction on what data to look at.

The documents included here are summary documents, including a summary PDF provided to the client (Dr. Donnelly) and a PowerPoint presentation given to my peers in class.
